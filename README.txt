We chose Lob Pong for this Project. (The theme for the game is Finals Week)
Description of the game:

You use the Left and right arrow keys to move the paddle and you can press Escape anytime you want to finish the game. 
The game lasts 1 minute and the user has to prevent the ball from falling on the floor with the paddle for that amount of time. 
The user has 3 lives and loses one everytime the ball falls on the floor. The game is over if all lives are lost before the time
is up. The user obtains 1 point everytime they catch the ball with the paddle. The user can obtain extra points or lose points by catching certain letter grades -
A = +4
B = +3
C = +2
D = -1
F = -3
The user will have opportunities to catch more lives in the game.
After 1 minute is up, the user is shown their total score. 

The yellow bar at the upper left corner of the screen is the time bar for the user showing the reamaining time left for the game. 
The three starbucks coffee images on the upper right corner of the screen are the lives for the user. 
The score is shown beside the time bar.
